The _Fibonacci sequence_ is defined by the following rule. The first two values in the sequence are 1 and 1. Every subsequent value is the sum of the two values preceding it. For example, the third value is 1 + 1 = 2, the fourth value is 1 + 2 = 3, and the fifth is 2 + 3 = 5. If _fn_ denotes the nth value in the Fibonacci sequence, then

 _f_ 1 = 1
_f_ 2 = 1
_f_ _n_ = _f_ _n-1_ + _f_ _n-2_ if _n_ > 2 

In computing, **memoization** or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
